# Hi (Moin)!

Im Konstantine, a double-degree Business Studies student with a background in Economics.  
After four years studying economics (and some data related courses along the way), I got curious about data science and how it can be leveraged to solve real business and policy problems.

These days, Im learning and experimenting with Python and its comprehensive packages for data analysis and doing some tidyverse in R.

Im eager to keep learning, improving, and taking on new projects that challenge me to grow.
