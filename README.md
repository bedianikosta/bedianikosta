# Hi (Moin)!

I’m Konstantine, a double-degree Business Studies student with a background in Economics.  
After four years studying economics, I’ve developed a strong interest in **data science** and how data can be used to solve real business and policy problems.

I’m eager to keep learning, improving, and taking on new projects that challenge me to grow.
